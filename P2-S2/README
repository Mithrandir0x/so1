ASSIGNMENT 2 - STEP 2

The kernel has been modified to support process with priorities that change
over the time, instead of having static priorities like in the previous step.

It is possible to execute the code by calling in shell:

$ make clean
$ make
$ make exe

If you desire to pipe the output to a file, please use this instead:

$ make exe | sed -r "s/\x1B\[([0-9]{1,2}(;[0-9]{1,2})?)?[m|K]//g" > log

My humblest apologies for making you use this command, but as the need of
separating userspace log from kernelspace growed, I found out colors that the
term love, and how could I refuse to such candy?

So, what does sed do? Simply filter every terminal lovely color to dull nullness.

Anyway, how's your day being so far?

SPECIAL MACROS AT "kernel.h":

__KRN_DBG_UPDATE_SLEPT_PROCESS__
  Defining this macro enables debug logs when process TTS are being updated.

__KRN_DBG_UPDATE_WORKING_PROCESS__
  Defining this macro enables debug log when process effective priority is
  being updated.
