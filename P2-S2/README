ASSIGNMENT 2 - STEP 2 -------------------------------------------------------------------

The kernel has been modified to support process with priorities that change
over the time, instead of having static priorities like in the previous step.

With this assignment, I tried to keep the names of functions and variables required
to be implemented as the doc requires, but there are some that I left them:

- fijar_prio                -> sys_set_priority
- replanificacion_pendiente -> f_pending_schedulling

Also, notice that the kernel logs use escape color chars to separate kernel logging,
kernel exceptions and userspace logging visually. If it is absolutely required to
remove all color awesomeness, replace to empty string this expressions:

- \033[1m\033[31m
- \x1B[31m
- \x1B[0m

CODE EXECUTION --------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is possible to execute the code by calling in shell:

$ make clean
$ make
$ make exe

MAKE TARGETS ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

$ make log

This target allows to boot the kernel and pipe the output through a log file
named "kr.log", without having to see the color escape chars.

SPECIAL MACROS --------------------------------------------------------------------------

"kernel.h":

__KRN_DBG_UPDATE_SLEPT_PROCESS__
  Defining this macro enables debug logs when process TTS are being updated.

TROUBLESHOOTING -------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you desire to pipe the output to a file, please use this instead:

$ make exe | sed -r "s/\x1B\[([0-9]{1,2}(;[0-9]{1,2})?)?[m|K]//g" > kr.log

My humblest apologies for making you use this command, but as the need of
separating userspace log from kernelspace growed, I found out colors that
term loves, and how could I refuse to such candy?

So, what does sed do? Simply filter every terminal lovely color to dull nullness.

Anyway, how's your day being so far?
