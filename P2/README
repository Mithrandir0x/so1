ASSIGNMENT 2 - STEP 1 -------------------------------------------------------------------

The kernel has been modified to support process with priorities. If a slept
process with a higher priority than current executing one awakes, the CPU will
swap the context to execute the slept-to-awake process.

Be careful!! It requires you to push any key to ensure that the test ends.

CODE EXECUTION --------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is possible to execute the code by calling in shell:

$ make clean
$ make
$ make exe

SPECIAL MACROS --------------------------------------------------------------------------

"kernel.h":

__KRN_DBG_UPDATE_SLEPT_PROCESS__
  Defining this macro enables debug logs when process TTS are being updated.
